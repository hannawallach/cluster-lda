On dalisrv there is an additional script:

#/bin/bash

RUNS=5

for PRIOR in `echo UP DP`; do
  for THETA in `echo 0.25 0.5 1.0 2.0 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0`; do
    for ID in `seq 1 ${RUNS}`; do

      # form the directory name

      DIR_BASE=results/cluster/core/C25-SG2000-SC1-THETA
      DIR=${DIR_BASE}${THETA}-SAMPLEfalse-DOCCOUNTStrue-${PRIOR}-ID${ID}

      # grab 20 lines of the log_prob file

      head -20 ${DIR}/log_prob_test_permutations.txt > ${DIR}/tmp.txt
      mv ${DIR}/tmp.txt ${DIR}/log_prob_test_permutations.txt

      # grab 4002 lines from the stdout file

      head -4002 ${DIR}/permute_evaluate_stdout.txt > ${DIR}/tmp.txt
      mv ${DIR}/tmp.txt ${DIR}/permute_evaluate_stdout.txt

    done
  done
done

I believe this script should be run after "run_test.sh" (or
"run_test_qsub.sh") but before compute_av_test_log_probs.sh since
"run_test.sh" is the script that invokes the Makefile target that
creates "log_prob_test_permutations.txt" (and, in the process,
"permute_evaluate_stdout.txt")

I have no idea why this is being done... The script also contains the
following commands in the inner loop, which look as though they might
be an attempt to do a more robust version of the above....

      if [ ! -e ${DIR}/log_prob_test_permutations.txt ]; then
        echo ${DIR}/log_prob_test_permutations.txt
      else
        echo -n ${PRIOR} ${THETA} ${ID} " "
	x=`wc -l ${DIR}/log_prob_test_permutations.txt | awk '{ print $1 }'`
        echo -n ${x} " "
      fi

      if [ ! -e ${DIR}/permute_evaluate_stdout.txt ]; then
        echo ${DIR}/permute_evaluate_stdout.txt
      else
        wc -l ${DIR}/permute_evaluate_stdout.txt | awk '{ print $1 }'
      fi
