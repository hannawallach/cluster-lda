* Running DP/UP code with thetas of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0 on
  dalisrv -- 5 runs per theta: ./scripts/run_cluster_qsub.sh DONE

* Create log prob files and plot them DONE

* When this is done compute P(cluster assignments under UP) for
  various different permutations of the data DONE

[Ideally we want to run UP code with different permutations too]

* Compute P(test data) under different permutations of the test data
