Comments from reviewers:

* Formal definition of the uniform process

* Asymptotic and simulation results for DP & PYP are well-known, and
  results for the UP are only interesting if it's a good alaternative

* Confusing discussion of exchangeability: "exchangeable" is a
  property of distributions, not cluster assignments. Talking about
  cluster assignments corresponding to the same partition might be
  clearer. Reducing to a canonical ordering for each partition seems
  problematic, since the distribution no longer sums to one.

* P(clusters) was incorrect in the old version of the paper

* Different ordering of the data will give different results

* No novelty compared to Shane's JASA paper (& the paper that
  introduced the UP). arXiv reference [3] is the sole theoretical
  result relating to this work (but is textbook).

My comments:

* Talk about the lack of exchangeability (maybe talk a bit about Max's
  section 3.1 or use that way of describing it)

* Then talk about how for a fixed permutation, you have P(c) as given
  in your thesis, and talk about the corrected Gibbs sampler

* Then talk about the fact that we can't really sum over all possible
  permutations of the data, but that we can quantify the extent to
  which permuting the data affects the log prob

* Talk about the experiments on permutations -- so basically summarize
  that previous email I sent you -- and give the new plot
