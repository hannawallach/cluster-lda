A formal definition of the uniform process would indeed be a helpful
addition to our work. We will add this to the final version of the paper.

In addition to the empirical study, the key contribution of our paper
is the presentation of asymptotic characteristics for the uniform
process. These characteristics have not been previously published: the
arXiv reference is an unpublished technical report, not a conference
or journal publication.  While we agree that these characteristics are
primarily of interest if indeed the uniform process is a desirable
alternative to the DP and PYP, we note that there are many real-world
clustering situations in which the "rich-get-richer" property of the
DP and PYP are not justified, thereby indicating that there are many
scenarios for which the uniform process is indeed a desirable
alternative.

It is true that there is no simple way to guarantee infinite
exchangeability for the uniform process. We will clarify and extend
the discussion of exchangeability as suggested.

-----------------------------

Equation 4 is indeed incorrect and we thank the reviewer for pointing
this out. We will correct that section in the final version of our
paper.  Although non-exchangeability is a serious issue (and does mean
that equation 16 is technically incorrect), we have several strategies
for accounting for non-exchangeability that will be included in the
final version of our paper. More generally, however, we believe that
the uniform process is a useful alternative to the DP that sacrifices
exchangeability for elimination of the rich-get-richer property, which
can be a desirable trade-off for many applications.

Response to Reviewer ID# 3436
-----------------------------

Our paper contains two contributions: a theoretical exploration of the
uniform process and an empirical comparison of the uniform process
with the DP on a real-world document clustering application. Neither
contribution has been published previously; the arXiv reference is an
unpublished technical report, not a conference or journal publication.
Although the uniform process has been discussed previously, the
application presented in our manuscript is new and provides a richer
and more conclusive comparison of the uniform and Dirichlet processes
than previous work.
